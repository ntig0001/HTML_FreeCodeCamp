            <ul class="unordered">
              <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, 
                thanks<br> to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> 
                Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> them", he said. 
                "All of this left scars on me."<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to 
                budget<br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br> Stakman, 
                who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, 
                but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br> to 
                control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> 
                pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 
                16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including 
                different varieties for each major climate on Earth.<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat<br> 
                yields<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> 
                American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 
                95% of Mexico's wheat.<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to 
                the Indian<br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> 
                expanding population<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize 
                and<br> sorghum yields<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." 
                Argues<br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we 
                run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've 
                been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br> time. Long before we called it 
                science, people were selecting the best breeds."<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.<br></li>
